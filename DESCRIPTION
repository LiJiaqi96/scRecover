Description: scRecover is an R package for imputation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data.
    It will detect and impute dropout values in a scRNA-seq raw read counts matrix while 
    keeping the real zeros unchanged. Since there are both dropout zeros and real zeros in 
    scRNA-seq data, imputation methods should not impute all the zeros to non-zero values.
    To distinguish dropout and real zeros, scRecover employs the Zero-Inflated Negative 
    Binomial (ZINB) model for dropout probability estimation of each gene and accumulation 
    curves for prediction of dropout number in each cell. By combination with scImpute, SAVER 
    and MAGIC, it not only detects dropout and real zeros at higher accuracy, but also 
    improve the downstream clustering and visualization results.
